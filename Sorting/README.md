## Things to do:

- Sorting techniques to add:
    * Merge sort
    * Quick sort
    * Heap sort

- Practice cyclic sort interview questions, create a sepeare java class file for that and add codes to it.

- Make some codes modularized. if possible, create seperate java file for code that can be modularized. (Codes like insertion sort, selection sort can be modularized)

- Add a readme file after creating a seperate class for appropriate sorting techniques. With explanation of each techniques.
