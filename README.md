Cheat Sheet:
- Fibonacci Nth Term Formula:
  * The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence can be calculated using Binet's formula, which is an explicit closed-form expression. The formula is given by:

    $F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (1 - \varphi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}, \quad \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$

- Akra-Bazzi Formula for finding time complexities of divide and conquer type recurrance relations:

  * $T(x) = \Theta\left( x^p \left( 1 + \int_{1}^{x} \frac{g(u)}{u^{p+1}} \, \mathrm{d}u \right) \right), \quad \text{where } p \text{ satisfies } \sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i b_i^p = 1$
